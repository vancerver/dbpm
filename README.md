Database Password Manager (DBPM) securely stores, updates, and synchronizes database passwords and allows applications to use those passwords without hard coding them anywhere.

The system is a standalone Java Swing desktop application.

This application is an open source alternative to Secret Server by Thycotic Software.

Current roadmap for the system is to create a web interface for the password manager engine and increase the number of interfaces it can support.
